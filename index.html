          In many people's opinion, dogs are better than cats. Dogs are more trainable,
          use the bathroom outside, can protect you, and promote a more active lifestyle.
          Having a dog has many benefits that make it better than having a cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is possible to think one is better than the other but still love both.
          Let's explore some reasons why dogs may be better than <a href="#">cats</a>. (Not to worry, cat
          lovers! There are also a lot of reasons why <a href="#">cats can be better than dogs</a>.)

        </h2>

          It's probably fair to say that even cat lovers don't love litter boxes. No matter how well you keep
          up with them, there always seems to be a lingering odor. Plus, litter often tracks all over the house.
          It's practically impossible to find a good place to put the litter box in a small house. Scooping the
          stuff is stinky and dusty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dogs don't need litter boxes. They can be <a href="#">house-trained</a> and most can stick to a schedule. They can use
          the yard or do their business during walks around the neighborhood. You only have to pick up the poop,
          not the urine the way you have to do with litter boxes. And as for the poop, you can simply use poop bags
          on walks and a <a href="#">poop-scooper</a> in the yard. Cleaning up poop may not be fun, but many think it's the lesser
          of two necessary evils.
        </p>
        <p>
          Best of all, the poop and pee happen outdoors, not inside your home!

          There's only so much play you can do with your cat. Many cats love to play with string toys and they'll bat
          their little cat ball toys around, but it's almost like they're humoring you. They can play on their own, not
          just with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dogs absolutely love to play, and it's often interactive play that they want, especially with you. You can
          play <a href="#">fetch</a> with a ball or a disc. You can enjoy an exciting game of <a href="#">tug-of-war</a>. You can play chase in the yard.
          If your dog gets along well with other dogs, you can even set up a doggie "playdate" with another pup. Just
          make sure both dogs are healthy and will get along.

        </h2>

          Cats are usually sensitive to their environments and dislike change. Many dogs tend to accept change more
          easily, especially when their owners act like it's no big deal. Of course, there are plenty of anxious and
          fearful dogs out there, but as a species, they're often calmer in the face of significant alterations to their
          lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to introducing new people, pets, or items to your home or moving to a new house, cats generally
          need more time to adapt. They don't automatically trust that all is well. They want proof first. Most dogs take
          their cues from their owners. If you're cool and calm when that new baby comes in your door, chances are that your
          dog will be, too. Of course, some might not be quite as accepting of strangers.

          Try to control a cat and you might hear the tiny sound of kitty laughter. Most cats will go where they
          want to go, jump where they want to jump, scratch where they want to scratch, and mark whatever they think
          needs marking. Then there are those hairballs, which are most easily found when you're barefoot in the middle
          of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, dogs can cause a whole lot of destruction, but you can usually <a href="#">crate train</a> a dog and keep him and your home
          safe and secure while you're away. Most crate-trained dogs consider their crates to be their own special places.
          Try putting a cat in a crate or behind a closed door and you'll have one unhappy kitty
        </p>
        <p>
          Corrective training and a stern voice can have a lot of power over a dog. Try this with the average cat and you'll
          be lucky if he glances in your direction while continuing to do whatever he was doing.

        <p>
          Okay, cats can technically be trained, but even cat lovers admit that it's not usually as easy as training
          a dog. Even food-motivated cats will soon tire of training sessions and walk away. Or, they'll just smack the
          food out of your hand and eat it anyway. In general, cats train us humans better than we could ever train them.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, most dogs actually enjoy <a href="#">training</a>. It seems to give them a sense of purpose. It's a job, and
          most dogs love to work. Plus, many dogs are highly motivated by food and attention. They'll gladly sit, stay, shake,
          lie down, and roll over in exchange for a delicious reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dogs seem to display a sense of pride when they've done a good job. In fact, dogs sometimes misbehave when they're
          bored. They need more exercise and mental stimulation. Training helps provide the latter.
